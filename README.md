# autodiff_thrust
 parallel automatic differentiation engine written in thrust c++

this is a passion project i made to feel like i understand in internal structure of deep learning frameworks, Althought it's a bit lacking and also buggy since i don't have the GPU with atomic operations so it's not as optimized as it should be. 
there is also the issue with putting all the code in one file but tbf i don't care i fucking hate header files
